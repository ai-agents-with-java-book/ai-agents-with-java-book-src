Hi Lumina Support Team,

My name is Sarah Mitchell, and I’m interested in purchasing the Lumina Smart Desk. 

Before placing my order, I wanted to confirm whether the desk is compatible with dual-monitor setups and if the height adjustment memory feature supports multiple user profiles.

Could you please provide more details about these features?

You can reach me at (415) 829-3476 or by email at sarah.mitchell@example.com


Thank you for your help! Best regards, Sarah Mitchell
